# Get Next Line

This project aims to create a function in C that reads a line ending with a newline character ('\n') from a file descriptor, without knowing its size beforehand. One of the primary goals of this project is to explore the concept of static variables in C programming, and to gain a deeper understanding of memory allocations—whether they occur on the stack or the heap—manipulating and managing the lifecycle of a buffer, and the complexities that arise from the use of static variables
